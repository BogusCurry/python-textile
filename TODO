TODO

* Improve documentation, both of the code and Textile syntax.
** Not all functions have docstrings or adequate docstrings.
** Because the Textile syntax implemented by PyTextile has deviated from the syntax implemented by other implementations of Textile, PyTextile-specific documentation needs to be produced for end-users.
* Add Textile 2.4 functionality
** PyTextile should ignore everything within HTML comments
*** ==<!-- do not parse anything
     within these
     tags -->==
*** Currently, it turns the above newlines into breaks and tries to turn the doubledashes into em-dashes
** Unicode URLs
** Auto-numbered endnotes
** ols and uls should conform to the new manner of defining styles for the entire list and individual items
** Allow specified starting number for ordered list
*** This would also include adding the ability to continue the numbering from a previous list
** Definition lists
** Footnotes:
*** [\d\+] doesn't work after punctutation
*** Add new backlink functionality
*** Add [\d\+!] functionality to disable adding the link.  Although, what exactly is the point of this?
** Tables
*** Fix colspan
*** Add thead/tfoot functionality
*** Add colgroup functionality
** New special symbols
*** One quarter [1/4] symbol
*** One half [1/2] symbol
*** Three quarters [3/4] symbol
*** Degree [o] symbol
*** Plus/minus [+/-] symbol
** Add in support for textile comments: ###
*** This is low-priority.  Why would one do this?
